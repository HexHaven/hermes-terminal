  # Hermes Terminal

  **The TUI of the gateway this window is already on.**

  Hermes Terminal opens the real `hermes --tui` of the gateway this Desktop window is connected to.
  Local Hermes, or a remote dashboard you already signed into. Same PTY the web dashboard Chat tab uses.

## Powered by Hermes

Hermes Terminal is a community-built workspace tab for [Hermes Desktop](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent). It uses the Hermes plugin SDK, the gateway this window is already signed into, and the same profile-aware desktop environment you already use.

The plugin does not invent a terminal. It opens the stock TUI on that gateway.


## TUI in a workspace tab

Desktop's right-pane terminal is a local shell. This is not that.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Open**<br />Sidebar item **TUI**, palette **TUI: Open**, or Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+T. All three open the TUI as a tab in the main area, next to the chat. | **Stay**<br />Open it again and the tab comes to the front. Close the tab to end it. |
| **New**<br />Starts a fresh TUI on the connected gateway. | **Resume**<br />The session rail is `session.list` on that same gateway. Click a row to resume it, the way the dashboard Chat rail does. |

It is a tab and not a route page on purpose. On a remote gateway cold start the Desktop's route table can miss plugin pages registered late in boot. The pane tree does not have that problem.

## Same gateway. Same sessions.

Hermes Terminal keeps the TUI on the gateway you are already using, then stays out of the way:

- Hide the session rail from the header when you want the TUI full width.
- Drag the divider to resize. Double-click it to reset.
- Reconnect remints the WebSocket ticket and dials again.

If the window is on a remote gateway, that TUI is the remote one.

## Stock Hermes. One file.

Hermes Terminal is a single desktop plugin with its own **TUI** item in Hermes. The default launch works with stock Hermes Desktop without a separate backend, build step, or package manager. Custom working directories require the optional backend contract described below.

## Make it yours

### Install

The disk door is `$HERMES_HOME/desktop-plugins/hermes-terminal/plugin.js`.

On this box `$HERMES_HOME` is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`, not `~/.hermes`. Check before copying:

```bash
hermes config show
```

Under a named profile the root moves to `$HERMES_HOME/profiles/<name>/desktop-plugins/`.

The folder name should match the plugin id (`hermes-terminal`).

The same [`plugin.js`](plugin.js) file is both the source and the installable artifact.

### Symlink

Edits here then hot-reload in place.

PowerShell, as Administrator or with Developer Mode on:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\hermes\desktop-plugins\hermes-terminal" -Target "C:\Developer\Hermes\hermes-terminal"
```

macOS / Linux:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/hermes-terminal "$HERMES_HOME/desktop-plugins/hermes-terminal"
```

### Copy

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\hermes\desktop-plugins\hermes-terminal"
Copy-Item "C:\Developer\Hermes\hermes-terminal\plugin.js" "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\hermes\desktop-plugins\hermes-terminal\plugin.js" -Force
```

Then **Ctrl+K** → **Reload desktop plugins**. A load error also raises a toast.

## The TUI, not a local shell

When you open TUI, the plugin mints a WebSocket ticket for the current connection, rewrites it from `/api/ws` to `/api/pty`, and paints `hermes --tui` with xterm.js. Nothing runs in this machine's shell. See [Limits](#limits) for what that rules out.

## How the connection works

```text
Your Hermes Desktop  →  gateway ticket (/api/ws rewritten to /api/pty)  →  hermes --tui on that gateway
```

A remote dashboard must already work for Desktop chat. Loopback bind (`127.0.0.3`) rejects other machines. Auth has to be configured for a public bind. See the web dashboard remote-backend notes.

## Compatibility

Hermes Terminal uses the desktop plugin SDK. It needs a current Hermes Desktop with `getGatewayWsUrl`, and `getGatewayWsUrlFor` when the window is on a registry remote.

The connected dashboard has to be able to spawn the TUI. That is the same extra as dashboard Chat: `ptyprocess` on POSIX, `pywinpty` on native Windows. If spawn fails, `/api/pty` sends an ANSI banner and closes.

First load fetches xterm.js from jsdelivr, with esm.sh as backup. The Desktop SDK does not export a terminal emulator, and a disk plugin cannot import one. Airgapped machines will see that error until we vendor xterm.

## Working directory

Desktop resolves the workspace directory and exposes it through the public
`host.state.cwd` SDK atom. The plugin captures that value when opening a TUI or
choosing **New**, and passes it as the generic optional `cwd` input to
`mintPtyUrl({ ..., cwd })`, encoded in `/api/pty?cwd=...`. It does not inspect
Desktop project files or stores. An empty SDK workspace value or an older SDK
without this atom omits the input and preserves the existing launch behavior.
Reconnect keeps the original launch directory; switching workspaces does not
retarget a running terminal. Choose **New** to use the new workspace directory.

This requires the companion Hermes core change in the HexHaven fork: the gateway
validates the directory on **its own host**, applies it at PTY creation and through
the existing TUI working-directory environment bridge, and separates PTY reattach
identities by directory. Missing paths and files are errors, not fallback requests.
For remote gateways, the supplied directory must exist there; local paths are not
translated or mounted by this plugin.

With an explicit directory the plugin requests WebSocket subprotocol
`hermes-pty-cwd-v1`. It does not accept an unacknowledged connection as a successful
launch. Older gateways need the companion patch; they may start their old default
PTY before the client disconnects. Without `cwd`, no subprotocol is requested and
older gateways remain compatible. This changes no standalone Hermes CLI flags.

Development checks for this feature:

```sh
node --experimental-vm-modules --test test_cwd.mjs
python scripts/build_catalog.py --check
python -m unittest test_catalog_policy.py
node --check plugin.js
node --check catalog/desktop/plugin.js
```

## Limits

- This is the TUI, not the old CLI. `/api/pty` always spawns `hermes --tui`. There is no stock remote CLI PTY.
- It does not type `hermes --tui` into this machine's shell. That would miss the point of a remote gateway.
- `openSessionInTerminal` (the OS terminal) is local-only and is not used here.
- xterm comes from a CDN on first open. Offline is a known miss. Vendoring a minified xterm into `plugin.js` is the fix for that.

## Standalone Desktop signed updates and recovery

At the bottom of Hermes Terminal, choose **Check for updates**. The plugin checks [its own GitHub releases](https://github.com/Adolanium/hermes-terminal/releases) and asks before installing. **Update now** downloads the offered version; **Later** leaves the installation unchanged. Checking alone downloads only release metadata.

Every update has an ECDSA P-256 signature verified against the public key embedded in the plugin. The signed metadata binds the repository, plugin identity, version, exact commit, file list, sizes, and SHA-256 hashes. Unsigned releases, changed downloads, and automatic downgrades are rejected. A signature verifies origin and integrity, not the absence of bugs.

The updater replaces only `plugin.js`. It requires no additional Python, Git, package manager, or updater service. All file operations use stock Desktop APIs on the **local Desktop profile**, even when the gateway is remote. Saved settings are preserved.

**Restore previous version** verifies the last complete backup and asks before restoring. Choose **Restore now** or **Cancel**. Updating or restoring reloads the plugin, so finish active work first. Terminal connections may close. Use **Reload desktop plugins** or restart Desktop if the screen does not refresh.

Backups remain beside the installed files as `update-<id>-backup-<filename>`. Failed replacements attempt to restore every original file. Desktop does not expose an atomic multi-file replacement: a crash between renames can require manual recovery. Close Desktop, move any replaced files aside, restore **all files from the same backup ID** to their original names, then reopen Desktop. For example, `update-<id>-backup-plugin.js` becomes `plugin.js`.

Existing installations need one manual installation of this updater-enabled version. Later versions can use the confirmation flow above. Hermes Agent source changes are not required.

### Publishing updates

The release description must contain a signed `hermes-desktop-update` block using schema 2. Publish a stable tag `v<VERSION>` against the exact pushed commit named in the signature. This plugin accepts only `Adolanium/hermes-terminal`, plugin ID `hermes-terminal`, and `plugin.js`. Signing is a maintainer operation; the private signing key must stay outside the repository and never ship to users.

<details>
<summary>Maintainer signing procedure</summary>

Update VERSION, test, commit, and push. Save this script outside the repository as sign-release.mjs and run node /path/to/sign-release.mjs FULL_COMMIT_SHA from the repository. It prints the path of the signed release notes. Publish with gh release create vVERSION --target FULL_COMMIT_SHA --notes-file NOTES_PATH. Keep the signed block unchanged when adding notes. Only maintainers need Node.js and Git.

The private key is read from HERMES_PLUGIN_SIGNING_KEY, or the maintainer's ~/.hermes-ssh-release/signing-key.pem. This is the existing family signing identity; signatures also bind each release to its own repository. Back up the key securely. Key rotation needs a release signed by the previous key or a manual reinstall.

```js
import fs from 'node:fs';
import os from 'node:os';
import path from 'node:path';
import crypto from 'node:crypto';
import { execFileSync } from 'node:child_process';

const commit = process.argv[2];
if (!/^[a-f0-9]{40}$/.test(commit || '')) throw Error('Use a full pushed commit SHA.');
const source = execFileSync('git', ['show', `${commit}:plugin.js`]).toString('utf8');

const names = JSON.parse(source.match(/files: (\[[^\]]+\])/)[1]);
const pinned = source.match(/const UPDATE_KEY = "([^"]+)"/)?.[1];
if (!plugin || !/^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/.test(version) || !repo ||
    names.some(name => !['plugin.js', 'probe.py'].includes(name))) throw Error('Invalid updater configuration.');
const origin = execFileSync('git', ['remote', 'get-url', 'origin'], { encoding: 'utf8' }).trim().replace(/\.git$/, '');
if (origin !== `https://github.com/${repo}` && origin !== `git@github.com:${repo}`) throw Error('Repository does not match origin.');
const key = fs.readFileSync(process.env.HERMES_PLUGIN_SIGNING_KEY || path.join(os.homedir(), '.hermes-ssh-release', 'signing-key.pem'));
if (crypto.createPublicKey(key).export({ type: 'spki', format: 'der' }).toString('base64') !== pinned) throw Error('Signing key does not match the plugin.');
const files = names.map(name => {
  const content = execFileSync('git', ['show', `${commit}:${name}`]);
  if (!content.length || content.length > 500000) throw Error('Release file exceeds updater limits.');
  return { name, sha256: crypto.createHash('sha256').update(content).digest('hex'), bytes: content.length };
});
const payload = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({ schema: 2, plugin, repo, version, commit, files }));
const signature = crypto.sign('sha256', payload, { key, dsaEncoding: 'ieee-p1363' });
const envelope = { payload: payload.toString('base64'), signature: signature.toString('base64') };
const output = path.join(os.tmpdir(), repo.split('/')[1] + '-release-notes.md');
fs.writeFileSync(output, `${repo.split('/')[1]} v${version}\n\nSigned updates and backup recovery, with confirmation before each change.\n\n\`\`\`hermes-desktop-update\n${JSON.stringify(envelope)}\n\`\`\`\n`);
console.log(output);

## Catalog package

The `catalog/` directory packages this Desktop plugin for the Hermes plugin catalog,
using the [combined package layout](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/developer-guide/desktop-plugin-sdk#one-package-both-sdks).
Catalog admission is pending. The repository does not imply approval or endorsement.

To install the package directly before catalog admission:

```sh
hermes plugins install Adolanium/hermes-terminal/catalog
```

Restart Hermes Desktop or rescan plugins, then enable the Desktop component in
Capabilities > Plugins. This package adds no Agent tools, hooks, or middleware.
It requires Hermes Desktop with combined-package support. On a remote backend,
the Desktop component must also be installed on the machine running the app.

The existing root `plugin.js` remains the standalone distribution. Keep one
installation per Desktop plugin. Before switching from a manual install, back up
and move its folder out of the Desktop plugin directory; Hermes intentionally
does not overwrite manual installations. Keep plugin settings when migrating.

After catalog admission, use `hermes plugins update hermes-terminal` and rescan
Desktop plugins to adopt a reviewed update. The packaged copy has no in-app update or restore controls. Its release downloader, signature verifier, backup/restore updater, and code-replacement helpers are removed at build time. Standalone signed updates
continue to use the existing root files.

For development, edit the root files, then run `python scripts/build_catalog.py`.
Commit the resulting `catalog/` files. CI runs `python scripts/build_catalog.py --check`
to keep the package current, including any companion files. Catalog packaging
releases use `catalog-v0.0.3-2` and are not marked as the latest standalone release.
